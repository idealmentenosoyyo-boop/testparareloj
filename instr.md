Beesure GPS  SeTracker Server Protocol
  ---Update time on Aug.02, 2025

Server Protocol contents (Free of charge)

Device System firmware software is Language C ;( per company regulation, not ok to open any port for device system bottom software developing)
App software language for IOS version is Object C,yet language for Android version is Java. 
The server language is Node. JS

key encryption is AES128, without MQTT( per company regulation, you can purchase our key protocol )
Note: all the devices we FOTA to your server without any key .

IMPORTANT NOTE: Your server end should turn off Active in server setting, since our device bottom layer already with LK every 5-8 minutes for keep the network connection, if you set your server Active, it will often stop the LK connections from the device .This is main issue some clients configuration our device in their serve and it drain down the battery very fast!!!(If you can not find it in your server , please kindly search TCP Active in google, you will understand it )

****All the command on Server in Hex.
****Server Protocol all GPRS Communications, devices work with sim card through Operator cellular network          

No any space in the command strings.

In the whole protocol all the command strings in the defined format of [manufacture*Device ID*content length*content], 

*** the manufacturer defined two bit only, device ID is 10 numbers comes from the device IMEI ,IMEI registered in your server , the server identify the device per device ID number,the content length defined are 4 bit ASCII code, and the high digit bit forward and low digit bit afterward. from left to right,high digit bit  is on the left ,low digit bit is on the right. )

For example, ASCII FFFF means the length is 65535.

LEN is always change in each command string base on the correspondings content lenght , Example , length 162 in ASCII code is 00A2

For example:

Device send :
[SG*YYYYYYYYYY*LEN*LK,steps,sleep body tumbling number ,battery capacity percentage]

eg.[3G*8800000015*000D*LK,50,100,100]
44444
Note: Any string or command should start with [ and end with ],this is exactly comply even on server end TCP command .

IMEI number
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PART I. Device send command
1. Link Keep=LK ( heartbeat package)
(1) Device Send:
 [CS*YYYYYYYYYY*LEN*LK]
 Example:[3G*8800000015*0002*LK]
Server reply:
[CS*YYYYYYYYYY*LEN*LK]
Example:[3G*8800000015*0002*LK]

Note:Once connected with local network, the LK string will be send every 5-8 minutes, if the device not receive the reply from the server or the server not reply properly per our protocol , then it will send the linkkeep every minute, after failure of connection 5 times, the device will reboot

(2) Device Send:
[CS*YYYYYYYYYY*LEN*LK,step,sleep body tumbling number,battery status percentage]
Example:[3G*8800000015*000D*LK,50,100,100]

Server reply:
[CS*YYYYYYYYYY*LEN*LK]
Example:[3G*8800000015*0002*LK]

Note: Once connected network, the LK will be send every 5-8 minutes, if the device not receive the reply or confirm from the server properly per our protocol, then it will send LK every minute, after failure of link 5 times, the device will be auto reboot

【Both of upon (1)and (2) LK command exist and valid from device】

Very important tip: The server must reply all LK command per our protocl! Otherwise the device will not send any other data , it will keep on sending the LK command every minute. Because the LK command is the only one maintenance the network connection, it's handshake between device and server .

The most important is the device send whatever Linkkeep, your server need reply or confirm the Linkkeep properly for maintenance the network connection
At the beginning half hour , the device send the Linkkeep every minute ; after half hour , it send Linkkeep every 5-8minutes
This is handshakes between device and your server , so they know each other for keep the network connection, if not, the network disconnect;DO NOT SEND ANY STRANGE COMMAND to cause the disconnection or data traffic.

***Set your server to persistent connection, after reply the LK , not disconnection.(Important )

2. Position data (UD string)
Device Send:
[CS*YYYYYYYYYY*LEN*UD, the position data (Refer to Appendix I)]

Device not reply this command, directly disconnect the current connection, it will auto connect the new server, but it need wait 5-8minutes , restart the device for exchange ip and port and check it on new server end.

Note: this is for change device report all data to your private server  IP and port.

( Note: No more SMS command to change the device server IP and port per EU required for safety issue.Only can send TCP command to change the server portal setting from the server end )

1)Device on our server end ,just let us know the device imei, our engineer will remote FOTA to change it to your server 
2)Device on your server, you can send the TCP command from your server end to change it to any server 
(after TCP command , just need wait 6-8minutes , restart the device and check it on your server portal)

*** for test the demo, you can advise us the device IMEI and your serer IP and port , our engineer will shift the device from our server end to your server ,once after device on your server , you can shift the device from your server to any other server . For bulk order, we will preset all your devices with your server Ip and port in the software before shipping it to you
